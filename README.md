# ToDo-PHP

In this project I be creating a simple Todo application that will be used to create, read, update and delete data and be able to save these information in a database.

This project is created from scratch and the purpose of this project is to show my knowledge in PHP, HTML, CSS and database management using mysql and phpmyadmin.
